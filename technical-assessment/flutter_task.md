**Step 2:** Populate <a href="https://github.com/ismailasega/ProjectCode_SoftWorld_interview/blob/main/technical-assessment/flutter_task.md#list-payments">Latest Payments</a> page with data from API:

**Step 3:** On <a id="create-payments">Create New Payment</a> page, post a new bill payment to the server:

- The form should not post empty fields with clear warning messages
- The newly created bill payment should appear as the first item on <a id="list-payments">Latest Payments</a> page

**Step 4:** On <a id="list-payments">Latest Payments</a> when a payment is tapped, navigate to <a id="view-payment">View Single Payment</a>:

- The payment data <mark>SHOULD NOT</mark> be passed as argument for the <a id="view-payment">View Single Payment</a> page
- <mark>DO NOT USE</mark> local storage to persist bill payment details

**Step 5:** Use <a id="update-payment">Update Payment</a> page, post payment changes bill to the server:
